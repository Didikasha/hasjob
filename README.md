Hasjob runs on [Python][] with the [Flask][] microframework. You will need
to install all the requirements listed in `requirements.txt` using
`easy_install` or `pip`:

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

If you get an error, try running:

    $ easy_install -U setuptools


Next, Copy `settings-sample.py` to `settings.py`, edit as
necessary, and finish configuration with:

    $ python manage.py db create
    $ python manage.py configure

To run the server in development mode:

    $ python runserver.py

WSGI is recommended for production. For Apache: enable `mod_wsgi` and make a
`VirtualHost` with:

    WSGIScriptAlias / /path/to/website.wsgi

For Nginx, run website.py under uWSGI and proxy to it:

    location / {
        include uwsgi_params; # Include common uWSGI settings here
        uwsgi_pass 127.0.0.1:8093;
        uwsgi_param UWSGI_CHDIR /path/to/hasjob/git/repo/folder;
        uwsgi_param UWSGI_MODULE website;
    }
